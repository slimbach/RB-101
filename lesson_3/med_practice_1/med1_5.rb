# What's wrong with the code?
# => 'limit' needs to be set inside the method

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  limit = 15
  while first_num + second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"

# How would you fix this so that it works?
# => put 'limit' inside the method before the while clause
