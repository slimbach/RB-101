# Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. 
#You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

puts "Enter a noun: "
noun = gets.chomp 

puts "Enter a verb: "
verb = gets.chomp

puts "Enter an adjective: "
adjective = gets.chomp 

puts "Enter an adverb: " 
adverb = gets.chomp

puts "Why did you #{adverb} #{verb} with a #{adjective} #{noun}?"

# Example
# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly

# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
