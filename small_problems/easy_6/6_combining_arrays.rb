# Write a method that takes two Arrays as arguments, and returns an Array that contains all of the values from the argument Arrays. 
# There should be no duplication of values in the returned Array, even if there are duplicates in the original Arrays.

def merge(arr_1, arr_2)
  arr_1.concat(arr_2).uniq
end 

# Example

p merge([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
