# Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and 
# returns a new String that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme 
# in which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are lowercase. 
# Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

def staggered_case(string)
  char_array = string.chars.map.with_index do |char, idx| 
    if idx.even?
      char.upcase 
    else 
      char.downcase
    end
  end
  char_array.join
end

# Example:

p staggered_case('I Love Launch School!') == 'I LoVe lAuNcH ScHoOl!'
p staggered_case('ALL_CAPS') == 'AlL_CaPs'
p staggered_case('ignore 77 the 444 numbers') == 'IgNoRe 77 ThE 444 NuMbErS'
